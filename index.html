			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Hey there! I'm <strong>Souvik Sen</strong>, a passionate learner and explorer on a journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. My educational odyssey began at Jay Ambe International, where I embarked on the exciting path of commerce. Now, I find myself immersed in the world of technology, pursuing my second year of Bachelors in Computer Applications at Parul University. Being in the realm of computer applications, I'm honing my skills and gearing up to craft innovative web solutions. My goal? To become a proficient full-stack web developer, weaving creativity and functionality into every project. Beyond the screen, I find joy in the thrill of computer games, diving into virtual worlds where every click opens a new adventure. Yet, my love for the outdoors pulls me away from the digital realm too. I'm an enthusiast of various outdoor sports, cherishing the adrenaline rush they bring. Wanderlust fuels my spirit. Traveling isn't just a hobby; it's my way of exploring diverse cultures and uncovering hidden gems. The allure of new places and faces keeps me constantly curious, sparking my creativity and broadening my horizons. Join me on my journey as I blend my passion for technology, gaming, sports, and exploration into a colorful canvas of experiences. Let's dive into the world of web development together!</p>
